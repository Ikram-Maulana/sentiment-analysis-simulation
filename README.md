# Sentiment Analysis Simulation

This is Next.js website that serves as a tool to simulate the sentiment and aspect classification process of a review text using Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm.

Live example hosted on Vercel: https://sentext.vercel.app/
Backend API hosted on railway: **_currently unavailable because limit of railway free tier_**

NOTE: The backend API project is private because it contains the algorithm code and the dataset used to train the algorithm.
